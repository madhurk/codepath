This is a simple Android app for calculating tip at a restaurant. 
While working on this app, I learned about Android layouts, integrating custom fonts, implementing compound components. 

Time spent: approx. 20 hours total

User stories completed:
-(Required) User is displayed the tip of specified percentage for specified entered amount
-(Required) User enters the total amount of the transaction
-(Required) User can select between tip amounts (i.e 10%, 15%, 20%)
-(Required) Upon selecting tip amount, formatted tip value is displayed
-(Optional) User changes the total amount and updated tip is reflected automatically
-(Optional) User can select custom tip percentage if desired
-(Optional) Experiment with trying input widgets to replace the buttons and/or textviews
-(Optional) Improve the user interface and experience by using images and/or colors

Features that took most time:
-Getting the layout right to implement the desired look and feel
-Integrating custom fonts
-Implementing compound component (EditText with increment/decrement controls)

Future todo:
-Make the EditText compound component generic so that it can be configured via XML attributes
-Use the above control to implement the bill split feature
